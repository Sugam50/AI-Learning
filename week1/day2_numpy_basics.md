axis = dimensions
nparray.ndim --> gives number of dimensions
nparray.shape(m,n) --> gives size of each dimensions therefore length = shape = num of dim
nparray.size --> total number of elements = (m*n)

Q2) What breaks if you don’t normalize data?
Ans) The mean variance and standard deviation will have error as the data will have negative values causing the issue
